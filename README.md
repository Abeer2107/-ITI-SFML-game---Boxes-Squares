# Boxes & Squares

## Implementation using SFML:
-	Vertical and horizontal line spaces are drawn separately (due to difference in number).
-	Grid size is 5X5 (dots).
-	A dim line appears when hovering between any two points.
-	A player is allowed to close two squares at the same time with one move if the chance allows it.
-	Players’ scores are maintained at the bottom of the game’s screen.
